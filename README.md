# Mentor Mart's Daily JavaScript Challenges - My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions and learning journey through the daily JavaScript programming challenges provided by **Mentor Mart** from Generation Thailand as a learner in Junior Software Developer Bootcamp Cohort 9 (JSD#9).

## About These Challenges

-   **Source:** Provided daily by Mentor Mart.
-   **Goal:** To practice programming logic, problem-solving skills, and JavaScript fundamentals, often simulating concepts encountered in technical interviews.
-   **Format:** Typically 1-2 problems per day, requiring self-designed Input/Output.
-   **Constraint:** Solutions are implemented purely in **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS) without HTML or external libraries, unless specified otherwise by the challenge.

## Purpose of This Repository

-   To document my attempts and solutions for each challenge.
-   To track my progress and learning over time.
-   To serve as a personal reference for concepts and techniques practiced.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by the date the challenge was given. Each challenge typically resides in its own folder named using the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

Inside each dated folder, you can expect to find:

-   `problem.md` (or similar): A description of the original challenge provided by Mentor Mart.
-   `solution.js` (or similar): My JavaScript code solving the challenge.
-   (Optional) `notes.md`: Any additional notes, reflections, or alternative approaches I considered.

## How to Navigate

Browse the folders corresponding to the date of the challenge you're interested in. Please note that these solutions reflect my personal understanding and approach at the time; there may be other valid or more optimal ways to solve the problems.
